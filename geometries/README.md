# geo/geometries [![Godoc Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/pchchv/geo)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pchchv/geo/geometries)

Package `geometries` defines common 2d geometries.
Depending on what projection they are in,
such as lon/lat or flat on the plane,
area and distance calculations will be different.
Package `geometries` implements methods that assume lon/lat or WGS84 projection.
